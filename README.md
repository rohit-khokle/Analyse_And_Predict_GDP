# Analyzing sectors that affect the GDP and predicting the GDP for various countries

* Government officials and business managers use economic forecasts to determine fiscal and monetary policies and plan future operating activities, respectively.

* Economic forecasting plays a key role in helping policymakers set spending and tax parameters.

## Objective

1. Analyze the impact of various sectors on GDP per capita over the years for various countries
2. Forecasting the GDP of the country using Linear Regression, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network


## Factors that affect the GDP

* Foreign direct investment inflow is the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor.

* Foreign direct investment outflow refers to direct investment equity flows in an economy. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, and other capital.

* Domestic general government health expenditure (% of GDP) refers to public expenditure on health from domestic sources as a share of the economy as measured by GDP, World Health Organization Global Health Expenditure database (http://apps.who.int/nha/database).

* Expense on goods and services is cash payments for operating activities of the government in providing goods and services. It includes compensation of employees (such as wages and salaries), interest and subsidies, grants, social benefits, and other expenses such as rent and dividends.

* Final consumption expenditure (formerly total consumption) is the sum of household final consumption expenditure (private consumption) and general government final consumption expenditure (general government consumption).

* Agriculture corresponds to ISIC divisions 1-5 and includes forestry, hunting, and fishing, as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Value added is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs

* Gross domestic expenditures on research and development (R&D), expressed as a percent of GDP. They include both capital and current expenditures in the four main sectors: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education and Private non-profit. R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.

## Conclusion
 Out of the factors that we considered in our analysis we found "Gross domestic expenditures on research and development (R&D) expenditure", "Domestic general government health expenditure", "Foreign direct investment inflows" to have a major impact in affecting GDP outcome of the respective countries.

Using the prediction models such as Random Forest, ANN on these factors help us to determine GDP two years ahead. This could help policymakers to make timely economic decisions.
